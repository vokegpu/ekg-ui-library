-- - or forced d-var sequentially.
-- Little optmization in `ekg::utf_decode` (break-line string decode to a vector of strings).

-- Added horizontal resize feature to listbox.

-- Fixed a bug where the index header dragged is the same as the original (same it hover some header).
-- Fixed a bug where the glyph that is not sampled returns glyph width size zero, which broken some widgets when is being calculated text width, now EKG get-once a wsize and map the new glyph on width calculation section (the rendering is also used to map the new glyph yet).

-- Added box option to `ekg::value_t<t, s>` (I know it is not how burrow and box from Rust works, just a stupid name).

-- `ekg::string_float64_precision` added for double/float64.
-- Totally deprecated the dynamic range, due the insanely unsafe issues, now it is type-specification-based (you must invoke f32 to float, i64 to uint64 but you are able to ownership infer type safety).
-- Added the left/right corners option to text in slider.
-- `ekg::layout::extent` now an type object `ekg::layout::extent_t`, plus two new externs (`ekg::layout::v_extent` & `ekg::layout::h_extent`).
-- `ekg::dock::none` option to the text in slider.
-- Fixed the scrolling timeout. Now it is working smooth.
-- Fixed a bug where the listbox was not scrolling if previously another widget was being hovered. Solution: Added a small focus state to listbox.
-- Fixed the scroll issue randomly stopping, the issue was happening due the high frequency not totally clean, then not letting a new scroll happens.

-- Fixed a glitch where the item hover attr flag was being spammed if scrolling fast.
-- Fixed a glitch where the addresed value was not clamped in slider widget.
